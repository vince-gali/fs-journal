# Intro to JavaScript
01. Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?

    <!-- > | var or let = are used to declare a variable in javascript | -->

02. What is the definition of a function?

    <!-- > | A function is what is used to carry out an action on an application | -->

03. What are the `SOLID` principles?

    <!-- > | The principles of solid are Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion | -->

04. Given this array: How could you remove the `pineapple`?

    ```js
    let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple', 'orange', 'strawberry']
    ```

    <!-- > | removed = fruit.splice(2,1);
        or
        fruit.splice(2,1); | -->

05. Given these two objects: How could you add each to the others friends arrays?

    ```js
    let you = {
        name: "You",
        hair: true,
        friends: []
    }
    let them = {

06. Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:

    <!-- > | if(dozen < 20){

    <!-- > | You can debug your code by using the debugger item | -->

09. What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?

    <!-- > | A primitive value is stored in the direct location that a variable gets access to while a reference value acts as a direction that points to a certain location | -->

10. Demonstrate a loop that prints the numbers between -100 and 100?

    <!-- > | for( let i = -100; i < 101; i++){
    console.log(i)
