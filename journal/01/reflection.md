# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Personally day three/four labs went very well. Day three was still a little rough as far as end product but am still proud of the baby steps

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

- What are you struggling with?
Main issue i have been struggling with would be a little bit with d-flex. Sometimes it is a little difficult to know when it is the right time to use it

- What would you count as a victory?
One thing i count as a victory would be that on day two i was feeling stressed because i was struggling with html
but by day three i was feeling more comfortable (yes i know there is way more stress to come)
